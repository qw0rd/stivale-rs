# Stivale_rs

This crate is incomplete and a work in progress. Contributions are welcome.

## What if a tag type is not implemented in the crate? 
You can either define the types within your own program or you can send in a PR
to fix this.
You use the `_tag` or `get_tag` method on `Stivale2Struct` to get the tag for
your missing type.
